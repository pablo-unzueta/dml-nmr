# DML-NMR
Delta-Machine Learning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (**DML-NMR**) is a set of python scripts to rapidly predict isotropic chemical shieldings at the PBE0/6-311+G(2d,p) level of theory. 

This project was developed by Pablo Unzueta and Gregory Beran at UC Riverside. Visit our [group website](https://research.chem.ucr.edu/groups/beran/publications.html) for our full publication list.

DML-NMR python scripts are written for **python3.7** or newer.
